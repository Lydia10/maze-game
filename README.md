# Maze Game 
The goal of this 10 x 10 grid (maze) game is to move to the last row or column. The maze is not shown, so one has to keep track of one's own path through the maze. The player can only move right or down. If a player hits a wall, the player loses. The program prints out the maze and the number of moves the player made before hitting a wall or reaching the last row or column when the game is over. The game uses singly linked lists to track the player's path.

- 0 means you can pass through
- 1 represents a wall
- 8 represents a player's path
